## Overview
### Description

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app will be focused for mobile users so they can directly link the songs they like to their spotify account. However, it can also be developed on the web and allow users to like and follow on there. 
- **Story:** Helps user branch out to find others who share their music taste, and view posts about what others listen to. 
- **Market:** This app is for all age groups or anyone who likes to listen to music. 
- **Habit:** People listen to music often, so they can use this app whenever they want. 
- **Scope:** This app can be used with other streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. A future implementation of this app could be allowing users to connect with each other (like Instagram DMs).
